This website is running on my [Raspberry Pi][raspberry-pi] with a 700 MHz ARM processor and 256Mb memory, these are not very high specs therefore i'm using Memcached. Memcached is a distributed memory caching system that is often used to speed up dynamic (database-driven) websites by caching data and objects in RAM to reduce stress on the webserver. This article handles the installation and configuration of [Memcached][memcached] on my Raspberry Pi running [Raspbian][raspbian] (based on Debian Wheezy).

I am installing the software from packages, [documentation available at Google Code][memcached-docs], with apt-get.

Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.


To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight php %}
apt-get install memcached
{% endhighlight %}
